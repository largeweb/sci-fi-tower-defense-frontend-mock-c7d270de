# Project Overview

Project Name: Sci-Fi Tower Defense (Frontend Mock)

Description: A web application that visualizes a sci-fi tower defense game. Users can see how the game could work. Note that because GenStack generates the frontend, the actions within the game are mocked, not real.

Features:
*   Tower Placement Interface: A grid-based map where users can drag and drop towers (mocked).
*   Enemy Waves: Visual representation of enemies moving along a path (mocked).
*   Tower Upgrades: A UI to "upgrade" towers, showing visual changes (mocked).
*   Game Over Screen: A screen shown when the "game" is lost (mocked).

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
